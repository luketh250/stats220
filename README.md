This is my repo for **STATS 220**.

## A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in **data science**
- I am taking **STATS 220** because it is a mendetory paper for my degree
- I am interested in learning about how *cultural differences* affect the process of carrying out tasks for different comunites

### Some Goals I have
1. Learn how to communicate the fundamentals clearly
2. Apply this to real world problems
3. Learn about the underlying variables that influence peoples desision making

A website that I find interesting is [World wind map](https://earth.nullschool.net/)
